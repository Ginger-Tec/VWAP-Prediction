# VWAP-Prediction
This is a research project where we designed several algorithms for volume-weighted-average-price (VWAP) prediction. Random forest and logistic regression were used for VWAP direction classification (up or down), while PCA was used for feature selection. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operato (LASSO) regression was performed to predict real VWAP value. See paper.pdf for more details.
